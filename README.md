## Description
#### Final Product
Our end goal is to build a web application similar to www.EventBrite.com that allows a user to organize events by creating online invitations, processing payments and track event related data. 
It also allows users to view and/or sign up for events. We plan to use various Microservices such as Catalog and SignUp to build the Application. We plan to host the application on Docker containers.

#### Phase 1 Current Phase
For Assignment 3a our goal is to build a back-end Events Catalog Service with seeded test data stored on local SQL database that lets the user test API options. The output is a key-value pair in JSON format. 
Examples include viewing picture associated to an event picture number or viewing event details by location or type of event.

## Requirements
